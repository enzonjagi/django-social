# Django-Social: a Django social media project

## Goals/Objectives
- Users will be able to either follow or not follow another user.
- If they follow someone, they‚Äôll see that user‚Äôs content. If they don‚Äôt, they won‚Äôt.
- Users can follow a person without being followed back. Relationships in the social network can be asymmetrical, meaning that a user can follow someone and see their content without the reverse being true.
- Users need to be aware of who exists so that they know whom they can follow.
- Users should also be aware of who follows them.
- In the app‚Äôs most basic form, users won‚Äôt have many extra features available to them. We won‚Äôt implement a way to block people, and there won‚Äôt be a way to directly respond to content that someone else posted.
